# Cleanhub Challenge

To solve this challenge I made use of the following tools:

- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [Vite](Vite)
- [react-query](https://tanstack.com/)
- [Material-UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/)

## How to launch the project

To run the project, you need a version of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) 18+.
If installed, open the project and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
```

Once the package manager has installed all the dependencies, to start a development server run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Follow the instructions on the terminal to find the correct localhost.
